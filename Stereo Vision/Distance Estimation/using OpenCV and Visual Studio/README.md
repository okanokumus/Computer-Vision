Distance estimation of a person through the stereo camera. Two cameras are used to camera calibration and 6x9 checkerboard pattern (it is available in this repo)are used for prework. 
After calibrarion matrices are obtained which name is 'mystereocalib.yml', finding distance process is started.
For one detected face in each frame, code works fine but more than one face and in the case of unequal detected faces.
*** the same algorithm is applied hich is used in MATLAB but the result is huge mistake Ä±f distance estimation
* Face detection or pedestrian detection or any different object detection method can be used.
